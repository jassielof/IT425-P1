  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;TtuloAbstract&amp;quot;&amp;gt;In today’s market situation and complex business environment, organization must be able to deliver the customer’s requirement and the expectations which are critical to the satisfaction such as high product quality, faster delivery and competitive cost. Organization need to apply a comprehensive concept and method on managing those requirements. The concept of Total Quality Management (TQM) is considered as one of a popular concept used to manage the quality of product and services comprehensively. This research is to observe is this concept and method still relevant to be use and effectively improved the business performance as well as customer satisfaction. It is a systematic literature review to the literatures from many industry sectors that were collected and reviewed in detail. The result show that this concept is still being used by many organizations around the world and its successfully help the organization to improve their competitiveness, business growth and the sustainability as well as increase employee’s morale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

  abstract = {A comparative study of energy management strategies and PQ improvement schemes for a Fuel Cell, Battery, and SuperCapacitor integrated Microgrid system has been projected utilizing the MATLAB/Simulink architecture in this research article. For effective energy management and PQ enhancement, a Modified Water Wave Optimization algorithm based on adaptive population size and adaptive wavelength coefficient has been proposed. The MWWO method robustly and dynamically tunes the parameters of the Proportional Integral controller for effective operation. The efficiency of the proposed technique has been compared with the traditional methods regarding hydrogen consumption, load power deliberation, power quality and overall system efficiency. The results obtained and the numerical analysis confers the superiority of the suggested technique over other methods for enhanced dynamic voltage response, low fuel consumption, reduced harmonics and better efficacy thereby proving its real-time employment.}

  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;O objetivo desse artigo consistiu em identificar, em uma empresa do setor madeireiro situada na mesorregião do Alto Paranaíba, características do gerenciamento da qualidade voltados para a Gestão da Qualidade Total (TQM) e uma de suas abordagens atuais, o Gerenciamento da Rotina do Dia-a-Dia (GRD). Para atingi-lo, foram coletados dados na empresa foco do trabalho, mediante entrevista com o gerente da produção e de observação buscando realizar o alinhamento entre teoria e prática. Dentre os resultados, discutiu-se a viabilidade da proposta de aplicação do GRD para o microprocesso prioritário identificado na empresa, a saber, o processo de produção do principal produto da empresa, a porta. Visando a melhoria contínua, sugeriu-se a implementação da metodologia CEDAC, a fim de incentivar a participação dos funcionários na busca pela melhoria contínua das atividades realizadas no dia a dia.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
